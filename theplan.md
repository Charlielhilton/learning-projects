# 🧠 Ultralearning Developer Portfolio Plan (Full Stack JavaScript + Web Dev)

**Author**: Charlie Hilton

**Inspired by**: _Ultralearning_ by Scott Young, Plan-outline created using _ChatGPT_ with prompts from [Tina Huang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDIrnL6nUkE&ab_channel=TinaHuang) then developed for personal use.

While the plan and breakdown documents were generated with the assistance of AI, all other work in this project was completed independently without AI involvement. (This does not necessarily apply to any external reading materials linked throughout.)

**Focus**: Master full-stack JavaScript, modern web development, and practical web application deployment through self-guided projects.

---

## 📌 Why

To develop strong, practical, and theoretical skills in full-stack web development — with the aim of building deployable, portfolio-ready apps that demonstrate real-world problem solving and front-to-back technical ability.

---

## 🧭 Learning Framework

This learning journey is structured around Scott Young’s **Ultralearning** principles:

-   🧠 **Metalearning** – Learn what matters and why
-   🛠 **Directness** – Learn by building real projects
-   🔁 **Drills** – Strengthen weaknesses
-   🧪 **Experimentation** – Explore, test, iterate
-   📚 **Retrieval & Feedback** – Practice recalling, reflect often
